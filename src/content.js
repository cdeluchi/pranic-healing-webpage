                    <p>
                        “Pranic Healing is a science. It is based on cleansing
                        and energizing. By cleansing or removing the diseased
                        energy from the affected chakra and organ, and
                        energizing them with sufficient prana, healing takes
                        place.” Master Choa Kok Sui
